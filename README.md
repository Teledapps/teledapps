# Teledapps SDK

This Python package contains a set of tools, which allows anyone to create Teledapps-compatible bot.
It's built over the [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) so you don't need any
additional experience except building Telegram bots with Python.

## FAQ

### Can I test my bot locally?

Sure! Since Teledapps SDK is built over the classic [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package,
you can run your bot locally or even deploy it outside of the Teledapps ecosystem.

### How to deploy bot?

You need to add it's source code into [registry repo](https://github.com/pavlovdog/teledapps-registry). Just follow it's documentation.
